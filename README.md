## My projects

> * [**react-fcctest**](https://github.com/Usheninte/react-fcctest)

This is an open source initiative, meant to help members of the freeCodeCamp program, have an easy way to test their React app projects. It is essentially a React plugin for the freeCodeCamp Test Suite.  

I broke down the process of building the React plugin [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/change-the-world-one-line-of-code-at-a-time-5162b229f35e), on the **official freeCodeCamp Medium publication**.  

It is [available as a package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-fcctest) on the NPM registry.

> * [**null-spotlight**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-fcctest)

This is an open source React portfolio web app template. I built this for both experienced and entry-level developers to be able to quickly highlight their key projects.  

I did this because building things is important, but sharing what is built is of even greater relevance.

> * [**blue HAZE (Poetry)**](https://github.com/Usheninte/blue-haze)

This a poetry React web app built to celebrate the end of my second #100DaysOfCode cycle in 2018.  

In 2019, I plan on focusing more on backend developement, and becoming a world-class Backend or Fullstack **Software Engineer**.
