## My projects

> * [**react-fcctest**](https://github.com/Usheninte/react-fcctest)

This is an open source initiative, meant to help members of the freeCodeCamp program, have an easy way to test their React app projects. It is essentially a React plugin for the freeCodeCamp Test Suite.

I broke down the process of building the React plugin [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/change-the-world-one-line-of-code-at-a-time-5162b229f35e), on the **official freeCodeCamp Medium publication**.

It is [available as a package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-fcctest) on the NPM registry.
